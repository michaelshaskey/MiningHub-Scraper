The Company can reduce the NSR to 1% through a $1,000,000 cash payment.\n\nAll Shares issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be restricted from trading for four months and one day after issuance.\n\nAmendment:\n\nThe Agreement, originally signed in February 2024 and amended in April and October 2024, has been further amended to reflect new terms agreed upon by the parties.\n\nAs part of this recent amendment:\n\nAtomic Minerals will pay the Vendors $10,000 by December 2, 2024.\n\nAn additional $115,000 will be paid to the Vendors by February 28, 2025.\nThis revision ensures a streamlined path forward, allowing Atomic Minerals to focus on its core exploration goals while meeting its obligations under the Agreement.\n\nAdditionally, the Company has, for strategic reasons, elected to return the Carswell, Parks Lake and Archie Lake projects from the original acquisition package to the Vendors. As a result, the Company's land package consists of four claims comprising three high-priority properties in Saskatchewan for exploration and development, which continue to demonstrate significant potential for uranium discovery.",

          "comments": "The Company purchased the 9-property package from an arm's length vendor in exchange for the following:\n\nA payment of $100,000 within five days of TSX Venture Exchange approval\n\nIssuance of 6 million shares of the Company within five days of TSX Venture Exchange approval\n\nA second payment of $100,000 on the 6-month anniversary of TSX Venture Exchange approval\n\nThere is no Net Smelter Return Royalty associated with any of the 9 properties.\n\nAmendment to Consideration\n\nThe Company's news release dated March 6, 2024 indicated that the Company had entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") for the acquisition of the Property whereby the Company would issue the following consideration to arm's length vendors:\n\na payment of $100,000 due within five days of approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"Exchange\");\n\nissuance of 6,000,000 common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\") within five days of Exchange approval; and\n\na second payment of $100,000 due on the 6-month anniversary of Exchange approval.\n\nThe Company has since entered into an amending agreement to the Purchase Agreement (the \"Amending Agreement\") which provides that the above consideration, including the issuance of the 6,000,000 Shares, will now be issued to a single arm's length vendor, being Evan Bell (the \"Vendor\").\n\nThere is a 2% net smelter royalty (\"NSR\") payable to the Vendor on any future production. The Company can reduce the NSR to 1% through a $1,000,000 cash payment.\n\nAll Shares issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be restricted from trading for four months and one day after issuance.\n\nAmendment:\n\nThe Agreement, originally signed in February 2024 and amended in April and October 2024, has been further amended to reflect new terms agreed upon by the parties.\n\nAs part of this recent amendment:\n\nAtomic Minerals will pay the Vendors $10,000 by December 2, 2024.\n\nAn additional $115,000 will be paid to the Vendors by February 28, 2025.\nThis revision ensures a streamlined path forward, allowing Atomic Minerals to focus on its core exploration goals while meeting its obligations under the Agreement.\n\nAdditionally, the Company has, for strategic reasons, elected to return the Carswell, Parks Lake and Archie Lake projects from the original acquisition package to the Vendors. As a result, the Company's land package consists of four claims comprising three high-priority properties in Saskatchewan for exploration and development, which continue to demonstrate significant potential for uranium discovery.",

The Revised Agreement now covers three properties – Corvet, Kaanaayaa and Wabamisk East (together the “CKW Properties”).\n\nUnder the first phase of the Revised Agreement, Rio Tinto can acquire an initial 50% interest in the CKW Properties from Azimut by funding $25 million in exploration expenditures (approximately $1.85 million already incurred) and by making cash payments totalling $1.7 million before December 31, 2028 ($800,000 already paid). Azimut will remain the operator during this phase. The terms are detailed below:\n\nRemaining firm commitment of approximatively $1.15 million to be incurred before the end of 2025 plus potential expenditures of $3 million to aggressively assess and test Wabamisk East’s lithium potential through detailed mapping and significant drilling.\n\nIn the three (3) subsequent years, minimum expenditures of $3 million (plus any unspent expenditures from 2025), $4 million and $12 million on the CKW Properties. These amounts include a minimum yearly amount of $250,000 in respect of each of the Corvet and Kaanaayaa properties to remain under option.\n\nCash payments of $300,000 per year, scheduled at the end of 2025 and the end of the two (2) subsequent years, for a total of $900,000.\n\nUnder the second option phase, Rio Tinto can earn an additional 20% interest over the following five (5) years with further work expenditures of $60 million. Rio Tinto will act as the operator during this phase.\n\nAzimut retains the right to be funded to the production stage by way of a secured loan from Rio Tinto by granting Rio Tinto an additional 5% interest in the CKW Properties (for a total interest of 75%).
