The Project comprises two granted\nexploration licences (EPM27134 & EPM27135) acquired from Anglo American with a further three adjoining\nexploration licence applications (EPM29278-29280) secured by SER immediately prior to the execution of a\nbinding definitive sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with Anglo American. Acquisition of the Diamantina\nProject is aligned with SER’s strategy of exploring the undercover extensions of mineralised terrains for\nAustralia’s next major copper-gold discovery. ",
