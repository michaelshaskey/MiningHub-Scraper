The agreement covers an area of approximately 147.68km², surrounding the\nCompany’s key gold resources at Lady Ada and Lady Magdalene.\nThe proposed acquisition represents a significant value-accretive opportunity, expanding Classic’s\nexploration footprint and delivering strong geological continuity with its core assets. The tenements\ncontain, as determined by past exploration, multiple high-priority targets across well-endowed\ngreenstone corridors, offering both near-term drilling potential and long-term resource growth upside.\nClassic is confident of being able to raise funds through Placements and/or a Rights Issue to pay the\npurchase price for these tenements. The Goldbridge acquisition consolidates Classic’s control over key\ngeological corridors at Forrestania. It aligns with the Company’s growth strategy by unlocking immediate\ndrill targets and expanding long-term resource potential across a cohesive tenement package.\nThe key terms of the Binding HoA are:\n• Total consideration of $400,000.00;\no $50,000.00 non-refundable deposit and\no $350,000.00 payable after due diligence and regulatory approvals.\no Classic will have 3 months to complete the due diligence process.\n• 2.50% Net Smelter Return (NSR) Royalty on any gold produced from the acquired tenements.\n• Completion is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of standard conditions precedent for a\ntransaction of this nature.\n• Parties are committed to satisfy the conditions precedent in a timely manner and, in any event,\nprior to 15 September 2025 (or other such date as agreed).",

The tenements\ncontain, as determined by past exploration, multiple high-priority targets across well-endowed\ngreenstone corridors, offering both near-term drilling potential and long-term resource growth upside.\nClassic is confident of being able to raise funds through Placements and/or a Rights Issue to pay the\npurchase price for these tenements. The Goldbridge acquisition consolidates Classic’s control over key\ngeological corridors at Forrestania. It aligns with the Company’s growth strategy by unlocking immediate\ndrill targets and expanding long-term resource potential across a cohesive tenement package.\nThe key terms of the Binding HoA are:\n• Total consideration of $400,000.00;\no $50,000.00 non-refundable deposit and\no $350,000.00 payable after due diligence and regulatory approvals.\no Classic will have 3 months to complete the due diligence process.\n• 2.50% Net Smelter Return (NSR) Royalty on any gold produced from the acquired tenements.\n• Completion is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of standard conditions precedent for a\ntransaction of this nature.\n• Parties are committed to satisfy the conditions precedent in a timely manner and, in any event,\nprior to 15 September 2025 (or other such date as agreed).",
